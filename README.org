* Consideration

*** org-linkany/url-source-collection

    This customize variable is used to complete the URL format of link.  
    In default, this item has the sources about the bookmark of firefox and w3m and hatena.  
    But, =anything=/=helm= may be errored by them.  
    If it's happened, customize this value to suit for you.  

*** org-linkany/browse-function

    For browsing URL, use =browse-url-firefox= in default.  
    But, this function may be errored because that depends on OS and Emacs version.  
    If it's happened, customize this value to suit for you.
