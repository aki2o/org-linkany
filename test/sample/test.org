* What's this?

  This is a extension of Emacs that is a explorer for the package structure of Perl.  
  You can handle the explorer in the same way as direx.el.  

  About direx.el, see [[https://github.com/m2ym/direx-el]]

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'plsense-direx)

;; Key binding

* Consideration
  
*** Performance

    2014/02/22, at present, the action of plsense-direx.el is very slowly.  
    I've sent the [[https://github.com/m2ym/direx-el/pull/37][pull request]] that makes improvements to this trouble.  
    But, if this trouble is not given improvement, you can get my improvements by using [[https://github.com/aki2o/direx-el/tree/tune-up-performance][my fork]].
